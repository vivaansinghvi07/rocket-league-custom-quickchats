Custom Quickchats for the video game Rocket League!

## Requirements:

  - Other operating systems have not been tested.
- [XBox Controller](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-for-xbox-series-x-xbox-series-s-xbox-one-windows-devices-pulse-red/6448932.p?skuId=6448932#anchor=productVariations)
  - Not tested with PlayStation or another brand
  
## Usage:
- Edit your quickchats in `prompts.py`: search for the `EDIT QUICKCHATS HERE` comment
- Make sure your d-pads (or whatever binds) are correct with `diagnostic.py` - if they are not, change them in the `main.py` function
  - These will be the constants `DPADX` and `DPADY`
- Run the script in the background, read the instructions, and enjoy!
